Spring Security
- It helps securing our APIs, microservices from unauthorized access, attacks, and threats.

Authentication
- It is the process of verifying who you are/valid user or not

Authorization
- It is the process of identifying you are allowed to access and makes sure you can only access what you are allowed to.

* As soon as we add "implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security'" a new filter chain called
  Security filter chain gets added which may have multiple filters.


 * At the end of the Security filter chain we will have Authorization filter.
    this will go to Authorization Manager -> It is a Functional interface that just has check() method to check if you have authorized.
